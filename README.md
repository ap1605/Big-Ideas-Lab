Take a name and font name and  make ascii art out of it.

All you need to do is type in your first name/word when asked, and then type in the font that you want your name/word to be printed in when you are asked. The code then will print out your name in the ascii font that you requested. 


You can contribute by adding in another ascii font to the code.
